# Introduction
## Supervised Learning
labeled object -> feature
## Unsupervised Learning
don't know how well you done
## Machine learning
> emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy
## Statistical learning
> emphasize models and their interpretability, precision and uncertainty
> Regression function: ideal f(x)=E(Y|X=x)
##  What if Y=f(X)+э & Y^=f^(X)+э   
> E(Y-Y^^2)=(f(X)-f^(X))^2+Var(э)
## How to estimate f^
> f^(x)=Average_of_sum_of_Neighbor(x)
## How to fit a flexible surface
> thin plate spline
## Some trade-offs
> Prediction accuracy vs interpretability
>> Linear models are easier to interpret, different from TPS
> Good fit vs over-fit or under-fit
> Parsimony vs black-box
# Assessing Model Accuracy
use MSE
