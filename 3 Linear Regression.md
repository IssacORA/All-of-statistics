choose the model with the least RSS  
interactive term 交互项，用两个特征之积构造新特征，有时比先前的特征更有代表性

	hierarchy principle  
without main effect, interactive term is hard to interpret a model, and it includes the main effect  
expansion: outliers/Non-constant variance of error term/high leverage point/collinearity
